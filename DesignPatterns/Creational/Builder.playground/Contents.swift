//: Builder - The builder pattern is used to create complex objects with constituent parts that must be created in the same order or using a specific algorithm. An external class controls the construction algorithm.

import UIKit

class DeathStarBuilder {
  var x: Double?
  var y: Double?
  var z: Double?
  
  typealias BuildClosure = (DeathStarBuilder) -> ()
  
  init(buildClosure: BuildClosure) {
    buildClosure(self)

struct DeathStar {
  let x: Double
  let y: Double
  let z: Double
  
  init?(builder: DeathStarBuilder) {
    if let x = builder.x, y = builder.y, z = builder.z {
      self.x = x
      self.y = y
      self.z = z
    } else {
      return nil
    }

}

// Usage
let empire = DeathStarBuilder {builder in
  builder.x = 0.1
  builder.y = 0.2
  builder.z = 0.3
